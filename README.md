# 2D WebGL Benchmark

## Abstract
A simple 2D WebGL performance benchmark that compares the libraries of PixiJS and the regl project with a vanilla javascript implementation.

This project is a preliminary work for the development of [SimBA, the simulation build assistant](https://github.com/stolsky/simulation-build-assistant).
